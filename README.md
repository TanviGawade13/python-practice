# Python Practice - Solutions from PracticePython.org

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from [PracticePython.org](https://www.practicepython.org/). It's a fantastic resource for beginners to intermediate Pythonistas looking to solidify their understanding and practice their coding skills through a variety of problems.

## About the Project

I'm working through the exercises on PracticePython.org as a way to:
* Strengthen my Python fundamentals.
* Practice problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
* Get hands-on experience with different Python concepts (e.g., lists, strings, functions, file I/O).
* Improve my Git and GitHub workflow by regularly committing and pushing my solutions.

Each solution is typically contained in its own Python file (`.py`), named to reflect the exercise number and a brief description (e.g., `exercise_01_character_input.py`, `exercise_02_odd_or_even.py`).
